Certainly! Here's a more stylized version of the Readme for the transcg-container repository:

# TransCG Container

Welcome to the TransCG Container repository! This repository contains a Docker container for the TransCG tool, a program for creating transliterated corpora from parallel text developed by the University of Arizona's Computational Linguistics and Language Acquisition Lab.

## Getting Started

To use this container, you'll need to have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

Once you have Docker installed, you can build the container using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t transcg-container .
```

This command will build the container using the Dockerfile in this repository and tag it with the name `transcg-container`.

## Running the Container

After building the container, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm transcg-container
```

This command will start the container in interactive mode (`-it`) and remove the container when it's done running (`--rm`). Once the container is running, you can use TransCG by following the instructions in the TransCG documentation, which is available in the container at `/usr/local/transcg/README.txt`.

## About the Container

This container is based on Ubuntu 18.04 and includes all the necessary dependencies for running TransCG. The container also includes a copy of the TransCG source code, which is installed in `/usr/local/transcg`.

If you have any issues with the container, please feel free to open an issue in the repository.

## Conclusion

Thank you for using the TransCG Container! We hope this container makes it easy for you to use the TransCG tool in your projects. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to let us know. Happy coding!
